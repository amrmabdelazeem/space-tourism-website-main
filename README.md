## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

1. Set up a new React project using `vite` or your preferrd method.
2. Install the `react-router-dom` library using `npm install react-router-dom`.
3. Structure the project accordingly with the figma design and create each related page.
4. Create a new component called App.js and import the necessary libraries and components, including `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Routes`, `Navigate`, `Home`, `Destination`, `Technology`, `Crew`, `Navbar`, `Sidebar` and others.
5. Define the state for the sidebar using the `useState` hook, and create a function to toggle the state of the sidebar in Mobile view.
6. Create the layout for the application, including the navigation bar and sidebar, and use the `Route` and `Routes` components to define the different routes for the application.
7. Create the individual pages for the application, including `Home`, `Destination`, `Technology`, and `Crew`, and import them into the App.js component.
8. Use `Sass` to style the pages and media queries for different devices compatibility.
8. Test the application to ensure that the routing and styling are working as expected.
9. Build the project using vite bundler.
10. Commit the code to a version control system, such as Git, and push it to a remote repository on Github.
11. Deploy the project with github action/ github pages or whatever is suited with the developer.
